# MCCC
This page provides information about managing MCCC (MC Command Center) settings in the SimsSwitcher application.
## Overview
MCCC (MC Command Center) is a popular mod for The Sims 4 that adds various gameplay features and options. SimsSwitcher can detect if MCCC is installed in your Mods folder and allows you to save and load MCCC presets along with your other mods. This enables you to easily switch between different MCCC configurations. When MCCC is detected, a "MCCC Settings..." button will appear below the preset list on the Mods page. Clicking this button opens the MCCC Settings popup, where you can manage MCCC presets.
## Features
- **View MCCC Presets**: See a list of all saved MCCC presets. Each preset represents a specific configuration of MCCC settings.
- **Save MCCC Preset**: Save the current MCCC configuration by entering a name in the text box and clicking "Save". This allows you to quickly switch back to this configuration later.
- **Load MCCC Preset**: Select a preset from the list and click "Load" to apply the saved MCCC configuration. This updates the MCCC settings in your Mods folder to match the selected preset.
- **Delete MCCC Preset**: Select a preset from the list and click "Delete" to remove it from the list. This helps you manage and organize your presets.
## Usage
1. Ensure that MCCC is installed in your Mods folder or a subfolder within the Sims 4 Data directory. The presence of the "mc_cmd_center.package" file is used to detect MCCC.
2. Navigate to the Mods page in the SimsSwitcher application.
3. Click the "MCCC Settings..." button below the preset list to open the MCCC Settings popup.
4. View the list of saved MCCC presets.
5. To save the current MCCC configuration, enter a name in the text box and click "Save".

7. To delete a preset, select it from the list and click "Delete".
8. Close the MCCC Settings popup by clicking the "Finish" button when you are done.
## Notes
- The "MCCC Settings..." button will only appear if MCCC is detected in your Mods folder or a subfolder. This is done by checking for the presence of the "mc_cmd_center.package" file.
