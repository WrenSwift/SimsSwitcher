# Settings
This page provides information about configuring the SimsSwitcher application.
## Overview
The Settings page allows users to configure various options for the SimsSwitcher application. This includes setting the Sims 4 Data directory, setting the Sims 4 Install Directory, importing and exporting presets, and configuring application behavior.
## Features
- **Sims 4 Install Directory**: Set the path to your Sims 4 installation directory. This is the location where the Sims 4 game files are installed. The default location may vary depending on your platform (Origin, Steam, etc.). You can click the "Browse..." button to select your directory. This setting is required for pack management features.
- **Sims 4 Data Directory**: Set the path to your Sims 4 Data directory. This is the location that the Sims 4 creates for storing user data, including mods, saves, and other custom content. The default location is usually in your Documents folder under "Electronic Arts/Sims 4". You can click the "Browse..." button to select your directory. Ensure that the selected directory contains the "Mods" folder. This setting is required for the mods management features to work correctly.
- **Export Presets**: Export any number of your saved presets for mods, MCCC, or packs to a specified location. This creates a json file containing the selected presets and optionally a zip file containing the mods needed for your presets that can be imported later or shared with others. Click the "Export Presets..." button to choose which presets to export and where to save the files. See Exporting Presets section on the [Preset Management page](preset_management.md) for more details.
- **Import Presets**: Import presets from a previously exported json file. This allows you to quickly add multiple presets to your SimsSwitcher application. Click the "Import Presets..." button to select the json file containing the presets you want to import. See Importing Presets section on the [Preset Management page](preset_management.md) for more details.
- **Application Behavior**: Configure how the application behaves, including the option to reenable the experimental warning dialog if it has been previously disabled.
